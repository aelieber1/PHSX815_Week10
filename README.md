- Write a program that illustrates, in some way, the Central Limit Theorem (preferably with one or more figures)
- For example, the Central Limit Theorem indicates that the normalized sum (i.e. the arithmetic mean) of random variables, each independently sampled from the same distribution, will asymptotically follow a Gaussian distribution. Try sampling a continuous variable from a probability distribution that is *not* a Gaussian - repeat this N times and take the average. Then repeat *that* again many times (so M "experiments" each with N samples) - what does this distribution of averages look like? As you increase N?
